Here is your task


In the below scenarios, have a go at suggesting two benefits of using data analytics and two ethical considerations.

Hint: Pros and cons lists are usually helpful.

Scenarios:

1. Customer loyalty at a supermarket is using shopping data to suggest products that a specific customer might like to purchase.

2. Medical bodies (such as hospitals and government) are able to allow insurance companies to see your medical history and data, so that insurance companies are able to better price their insurance policies.

3. Online maps use location data from users' mobile devices to figure out which restaurants are popular (i.e. by tracking how many people go to a restaurant through the use of GPS on people's phones).
